                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700 mb-4">A Growing Challenge in Higher Education Leadership</h2>
                    <p>Across higher education, the role of the university president has always been a challenging one. But in recent years, it has become what some have called a “position impossible.” The data bear this out. The average presidential tenure has dropped from 8.5 years in 2006 to 5.9 years in 2022. A 2023 industry podcast puts it at a strikingly brief 3.7 years. For boards and campuses, this means costly searches, more frequent leadership transitions, and, at times, institutional drift.</p>
                </section>

                <!-- Section 2: Why Strategy Matters -->
                <section class="bg-white p-8 rounded-2xl shadow-lg">
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700 mb-4">Why Presidential Search Strategy Matters More Than Ever</h2>
                    <p>The stakes of a presidential search have never been higher. Selecting the wrong leader—or conducting the right search in the wrong way—can leave a university vulnerable at precisely the moment when stability and strategy are most needed. When searching for a new president, boards and search committees may feel pressure to advance the kind of candidates that vocal groups want rather than identifying the type of leader the institution needs at this moment. The mismatch between stakeholder desires and institutional needs can make it difficult, if not impossible, for a new president to address what needs to be done in today’s “new normal.”</p>
                    <p class="mt-4">As someone who has served in the presidency at more than one university, I know, firsthand, that the search process itself shapes the presidency ahead. A search conducted without sufficient strategy, transparency, and foresight can unintentionally set up a new president for struggle rather than success. The chances of such struggle increase exponentially if the board wants and hires a particular type of leader when the campus wants another.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700 mb-4">Understanding the Two Critical Phases of Presidential Search</h2>
                    <p>In this blog series, I will explain the means and ends of specific phases: the **stakeholder input phase** and the **announcement and launch phase**. I will not only describe the “what is” but will also recommend “what should be.”</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-3 border-b pb-1">The Problem with Current Search Practices</h3>
                    <p>In a nutshell, it is frequently the case that these two phases are not only treated as routine but also as “reassurance rituals.”</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-3 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
                        <li>The stakeholder input phase becomes a stage for making nice with the campus community—offering people the chance to voice what they want, even when they may not have the full picture of what the university needs to survive and thrive.</li>
                        <li>The announcement and launch phase is similarly orchestrated to make the new president and the university look good. Flowery press releases, campus receptions, and community celebrations abound. Yet rarely are these moments used to call attention to the pressing issues awaiting the new leader.</li>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700 mb-4">Moving Beyond Superficial Search Exercises</h3>
                    <p>A presidential search must do more than generate warm feelings or ceremonial consensus. When key phases of the search are exercised for comfort and optics, they miss the chance to ready both the institution and its incoming president for what is needed at this particular place at this particular moment.</p>
                    <p class="mt-4 font-semibold text-gray-700">To be clear, the search should prepare both the community and the candidate for the real work ahead—the tough decisions, the unpopular changes, and the strategic pivots that are often unavoidable.</p>
